        <p>To get started with using the library, create a LearnJS object in your JS file. </p>
        <p>Then, add a list container to hold the learning objectives that will be added to it. </p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Recommended: Include a hide list button, move list button, and search bar as well to improve the usability of the library (see example pages to see usefulness).</i> </p>
