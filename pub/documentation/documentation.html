        <p>To get started with using the library, create a LearnJS object in your JS file. </p>
        <p>Then, add a list container to hold the learning objectives that will be added to it. </p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Recommended: Include a hide list button, move list button, and search bar as well to improve the usability of the library (see example pages to see usefulness).</i> </p>

                <li>Calling addObjective() in a filtered view will by default set the category for that new objective to the currently searched category. </li>
                <li>Reminder: the IDs of the learning objectives do not change during a filter, e.g. the first objective shown in the filtered view does not necessarily have an ID of 1. Recommended: make use of the getCategories() API method to determine the objective IDs (look at positions of returned array) that are currently shown in the DOM.</li>
                <li>If the searched category is an empty string e.g. filter(""),  then all the learning objectives are shown (default view is shown). </li>
