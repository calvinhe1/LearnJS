        <p><i>Write a title on top of the corresponding objective.</i></p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                //adding or editing titles for given objective number
                <span class="object">learn</span>.<span class="method">editTitle(1,"Learn how to add objectives")</span>

            </code>
        </pre>

        <br>

        <h3>Add/Edit the description of a learning objective</h3> 
        <p>The description is the information that is displayed in a convenient manner in relation to a learning objective.
        <p>
        <p> It acts as a summary a user can quickly review.</p>

        <br>

        <p>
        <i>Add/edit the description of a learning objective, this is the information that will remind users of the details of the learning objective. </i>
        </p> 
   
        <pre>
            <code>
                //First argument refers to the objective number to edit, second argument refers to the description itself.
                <span class="object">learn</span>.<span class="method">editDescription(1,"Users can click the press button to add an objective.")</span>
    
            </code>
        </pre>
      
       <p>The description can be edited through the form as well - view form/difficulty example for details</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Add/Edit the category of a learning objective</h3> 
        <p>
            <i>Add a search bar for future searches based on categories (will only show learning objectives matching the searched category) and add categories to learning objectives.</i><p>
        </p> 

        <pre>
            <code>
                //First argument refers to objective number to edit, second argument refers to category itself
                <span class="object">learn</span>.<span class="method">editCategory(1,"Add")</span>
                <span class="object">learn</span>.<span class="method">editCategory(2,"Delete")</span>
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>The category can be edited through the form as well - view form/difficulty example for details</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>Changing difficulty level of a learning objective</h3>
        <p>The purpose of these difficulty levels is to let the user know the amount of time/effort that needs to be invested to successfully understand the corresponding learning objective.</p>
        
        <br>
        <p><i>Change the difficulty level of a given learning objective (changes the shape and the color of the border of the objective to the matching difficulty level - see main page for details) </i></p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                //Changing difficulty level of first objective from easy to hard
                <span class="object">learn<span>.<span class="method">editDifficulty(1, "hard")</span>
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            The difficulty level can also be changed if user selects a different difficulty level than the current difficulty in the dropdown of the form and submitting.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3>Display details of a learning objective</h3>
        <p>
            Display all the details about a learning objective in a form (the title, category, and description). <p>
        <p>  
        The form can be optionally edited: submitting the form saves any changes and closing discards any changes.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Displaying the form of an objective.</i></p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                //First argument refers to objective form to display, second argument refers to on or off with 1 or 0 respectively.
                <span class="object">learn</span>.<span class="method">form(1,1)</span>
                
                //learn.form(1,0) to close the form. Must turn off a form before opening another form. 
            </code>
        </pre>
        </p> 
        This form can also be triggered if a user right clicks on a learning objective. 
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Displaying the list of learning objectives</h3>
        <p>
            There may be times were users don't want to see the list of learning objectives, so clicking the "hide list" button on the upper top left will hide the list. In reality, the list is entirely removed and then re-added rather than hidden, so it will not occupy space in the document.
        </p>  
            <p>
                Another very convenient feature, is the "move list" button, as it allows the movement of the list of learning objectives to whereever the user's scrolled position is at, allowing the users to interact with the list anywhere in the webpage.
