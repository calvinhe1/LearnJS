        <h3>Add the title of a learning objective</h3>
        <p><i>Write a title on top of the corresponding objective, this lets the users see the learning goal. </i></p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                //adding or editing titles for given objective numbers
                <span class="object">learn</span>.<span class="method">editTitle(1,"Learn how to add objectives")</span>

            </code>
        </pre>

        <br>

        <h3>Add the description of a learning objective</h3> 
        <p>The description is the information that is displayed in a convenient manner in relation to a learning objective (simply mouse over a learning objective to see; however need to close the form first).
        <p>
        <p> It acts as a summary a user can review so they can quickly learn a particular learning objective or ensure they have learned what is entailed.</p>

        <br>

        <p>
        <i>Write a description of a particular learning objective. </i>
        </p> 
   
        <pre>
            <code>
                //adding or editing descriptions for given objective number
                <span class="object">learn</span>.<span class="method">editDescription(1,"Users can click the plus button to add an objective.")</span>
                <span class="object">learn</span>.<span class="method">editDescription(2,"Users can click the delete button to remove an objective.")</span>
    
            </code>
        </pre>
      

        <br>

        <h3>Add the category of a learning objective</h3> 
        <p>The category is the group that a learning objective belongs to. This allows for the filtering of learning objectives based on category, so users can view just the learning objectives they are interested in.</p> 
        <br>

            <i>Add categories to learning objectives.</i>
       

        <pre>
            <code>
                //Adding or editing categories for given objective numbers
                <span class="object">learn</span>.<span class="method">editCategory(1,"Add")</span>

            </code>
        </pre>

        <br>
        
        <h3>Changing the difficulty level of a learning objective</h3>
        <p>The purpose of these difficulty levels is to let the user know the relative amount of time/effort that needs to be invested to successfully understand the corresponding learning objective.</p>
        
        <br>
        <p><i>Change the difficulty level of a given learning objective (changes the shape and the color of the border of the objective to the matching difficulty level - see the main page for details) </i></p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                //Changing difficulty level of the first objective from easy to hard
                <span class="object">learn<span>.<span class="method">editDifficulty(1, "hard")</span>
            </code>
        </pre>


        <br>
        <h3>Display details of a learning objective</h3>
        <p>
            Display all the details about a learning objective in a form (the title, difficulty, category, and description). <p>
        <p>It can be seen that all of the above example data (title, description, category, difficulty) are shown in the form above.</p>
      
        <br>
        <p><i>Displaying the form of an objective (the form open above in the beginning of the example page). </i></p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                //First argument refers to objective form to display, second argument refers to on or off with 1 or 0 respectively.
                <span class="object">learn</span>.<span class="method">form(1,1)</span>
                
                //learn.form(1,0) to close the form. Must turn off a form before opening another form. 
            </code>
        </pre>

        </p> 
        The form for a learning objective can be triggered by users if they right-click on the learning objective. Any of the fields can be optionally edited and if submitted will register in the changes. 
        </p>
        <p>  
        <b>Note: </b>When entering a category, recommended existing categories will show up. Users can either select a category in the dropdown menu or press enter to hide the recommended choices. Different capitalizations of the same category may be shown, however, are considered the same category.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Manipulating the list container</h3>
        <p>
            There may be times were users don't want to see the list of learning objectives as it may block existing content. LearnJS provides a mechanism to hide/unhide the list through a button. In reality, the list is entirely removed and then re-added rather than hidden, so it will not occupy space in the document when hidden.
        </p>  
            <p>
                Also, in scenarios such as this webpage, there may be webpages that are long and the list of learning objectives is not seen unless the user scrolls back up to the top. LearnJS provides a mechanism to move the list to wherever the user is through a move button.
            </p>  
        <br>
        <p><i>Add a move and hide button to the DOM. Fixed in the top left corner of the page.</i></p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                <span class="object">learn</span>.<span class="method">addHideButton()</span>
                <span class="object">learn</span>.<span class="method">addMoveButton()</span>
            </code>
        </pre>
